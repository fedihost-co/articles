# Migrating Mastodon

Moving a Mastodon account to a new server is easy as long as you follow the steps in order

## Limitations

There are a few limitations to Mastodon and things you should know about a migration first.

### Things You Can Migrate
* Followers - Automatically
* Bookmarks - CSV Download/Upload
* Follows - CSV Download/Upload
* Lists - CSV Download/Upload
* Mutes - CSV Download/Upload
* Blocks - CSV Download/Upload
* Domain Blocks - CSV Download/Upload
* Hashtags - Manual Data Entry

### Things You Canâ€™t Move
At this point your posts and media are [stuck on the old account](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/12423).

**Exception:** If you are already hosted on a custom domain and just want to migrate your hosting (not changing your domain) it is possible to keep everything. Your just need two things:
* A copy of your database data and media from your old host
* A new host that will restore this data for you (such as fedihost)

## Process
