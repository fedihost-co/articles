# Mastodon Apps
There are a variety of apps produced by independent developers for
smartphones (Android, iPhone) as well as for desktop computers (Windows,
macOS, Linux).

They access the same Mastodon data, but may present it to you in slightly
different ways.

## Recommendation Enhancements
One thing that some of these apps add is the recommendation of content.
For example pre-made lists to follow of news organzations.
