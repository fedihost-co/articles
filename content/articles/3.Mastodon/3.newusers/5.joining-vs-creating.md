## Creating An Instance
If you would like to host your own instance for a group of friends or
yourself, managed hosting providers are a good choice. If you have server
admin experience you could even [set up your own Mastodon server](/articles/thebasics/managed-hosting-vs-vps).

> **You should know**: Running an instance isn't for everyone. It gives
> you greater control over your experience and what kinds of content you
> see.
> The downside is you have to do a lot of the legwork finding content
> yourself or between you and your friends. That said, FediHost will handle
> the technical aspects so you don't need to worry about things like uptime,
> server administration, or security, and can focus on running your
> instance. If you want even more technical control over your instance
> (and are reasonably comfortable with Linux server administration or
> willing to learn), you can also [host your own instance](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites/).
