Managed Hosting vs. a VPS
===

**Managed hosting** is a good option for people with less technical experience.
**Self-hosting** is a good option if you enjoy technology or have experience
programming or managing servers.

## VPS

A *virtual private server* (VPS) is a server hosted in a datacenter as a
virtual machine. It shares a slice of a physical server's hardware resources.
It's generally the simplest, cheapest kind of professionally managed server 
you can get.

> have a virtual server running on a server with 10s of other small 
> companies. 

### System requirements

The kind of VPS you need for fediverse service depends on the size
of your instance. If you're just running a small instance for
yourself or your friends, you can get away with as little as 1 virtual CPU
core and 1.5 GB of RAM for most services.
If you intend to run a big instance, you need to scale up your hardware accordingly.

### Hosting Mastodon on a VPS

If you're comfortable with Linux server administration, the Mastodon setup
process is [well documented](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/).
You'll need to install some prerequisites, set up a database, and download and
configure a web server and set the Mastodon server app up on it.

> **Resource Usage**  Mastodon has a high base CPU and RAM usage that will keep a
> small server busy, it can also use a high amount of storage if you connect
> your instance to relays. 

### Hosting PeerTube on a VPS

Setting up PeerTube on a VPS is quite similar to setting up Mastodon - although
it takes some time, you can do it if you're somewhat familiar with the Linux
command line. You can view the [official
documentation](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#create-your-own-instance) to know
how to do it.

> **Resource Usage**  Peertube has a low base CPU and RAM usage when it is not
> uploading and processing videos. However when it is transcoding it uses
> a significant amount of resources. The documentation suggests 8 vCores and 
> 8 GB of RAM) for transcoding. This isn't needed if you do transcoding 
> remotely - using a **remote runner**, which the PeerTube documentation
> has more info on.

## Advantages of self-hosting

### More control

When self-hosting on a VPS, you have more control over your instance. You have a 
broader choice of server locations and hardware.

You also have direct access to the database and codebase allowing for
customization and full control of the service.

Also, if your country's laws or company policies require that your digital
services be hosted onsite, then self-hosting may be necessary for compliance
purposes.

### Server administration experience

If you're interested in getting experience running servers or using Linux,
self-hosting is a great way to do it - it's well-supported but is still a
challenge and a learning experience.

### Cost (Sometimes)

If you already have access to a server that you are using for other purposes
or your instance's size-based needs mean that you can get a perfect fit 
then using a VPS will be cheaper. 

With a VPS and time investment, you can save money compared to a managed
hosting provider, but make sure you know your needs hardware wise.

## Advantages of managed hosting

### Ease

Managed hosting is easier for most people. You don't need to
manage the inner technical workings of a service like Mastodon - just whatever
[configuration](/articles/mastodon/creating/configuring) you see in the online
panel. 

### Time
Fediverse services have a high "opportunity cost" when you self-host.
Setting up and maintaining a fediverse service is going to add a few hours 
to the workload of even the most experienced IT professional each year.
If you enjoy the process and see server administration as a hobby, it makes sense.
If you just want to focus on running an instance and do something else with
your time, managed hosting is the way to go.

### Less server maintenance worries

With managed hosting, you don't need to worry about keeping the instance up to
date, keeping it secure (other than making sure your configuration is sound and
your admins/moderators' passwords are secure), or figuring out what caused
things to break.

### Shared storage

If you're running multiple instances (especially different kinds, such as
Mastodon and PeerTube) with different needs for storage, FediHost and some
other managed hosting providers pool your storage across your instances. This
way, you don't pay for storage you don't need on one instance and run out of
storage on another. With a VPS, you have to manage storage capacities and
shared resources yourself.

### Peak Usage Optimization
For PeerTube in particular, people on a VPS are often stuck paying for an
expensive server to handle the resource hungry task of encoding videos.
Unless you're uploading a video every few hours, it is otherwise sitting there
doing nothing. Fedihost is usually cheaper than a VPS for PeerTube hosting 
because we have dedicated transcoding machines so you don't have to pay
for idle resouces.
