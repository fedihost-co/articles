Managed Hosting vs. Self-Hosting
===

**Managed hosting** is a good option for people with less technical experience.
**Self-Hosting** is a good option if you enjoy technology or have experience
programming or managing servers.

## Introducing Servers

A *server* is a computer running a program (such as Mastodon or PeerTube) 
that interacts with *clients* (such as your laptop or phone) over the internet.
When you setup your own fediverse service you have to decide how much of the server
management you want to do. 

In this article we compare running the server yourself (Self Hosting) versus
using a service that takes care of that for you (Managed Hosting) 

## VPS

Most people use a *virtual private server* (VPS) when self-hosting. This is a server 
hosted in a datacenter as a virtual machine - a virtual computer that 
shares hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc.) with other VPSs. 

It's generally the simplest, cheapest kind of server you can get.

### System requirements

The kind of VPS you need depends heavily on the size of your instance. If
you're just running a small instance (of either Mastodon or PeerTube) for
yourself or your friends, you can get away with as little as 1 (virtual CPU)
core and 1.5 GB of RAM. If you intend to run a big instance (lots of users, or
for PeerTube, lots of viewers), you need to scale up your hardware accordingly.

For PeerTube specially, you will need additional resources (as of writing, the
documentation suggests 8 vCores and 8 GB of RAM) for transcoding. This isn't
needed if you do transcoding remotely - using a **remote runner**, which the
PeerTube documentation has more info on.

### Hosting Mastodon on a VPS

If you're comfortable with Linux server administration, the Mastodon setup
process is [well documented](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/).
You'll need to install some prerequisites, set up a database, and download and
configure a web server and set the Mastodon server app up on it.

### Hosting PeerTube on a VPS

Setting up PeerTube on a VPS is quite similar to setting up Mastodon - although
it takes some time, you can do it if you're somewhat familiar with the Linux
command line. You can view the [official
documentation](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#create-your-own-instance) to know
how to do it.

## Advantages of self-hosting

### More control

When self-hosting, you have more control over your instance - you're running
and securing the server yourself. This means you have a broader choice of
location (so your users get good connection) and hardware, as well as direct
access to the database.

Also, if your country's laws or company's policies require that your digital
services be hosted a certain way with full access to the database,
then self-hosting may be necessary for compliance purposes.

### Server administration experience

If you're interested in getting experience running servers or using Linux,
self-hosting is a great way to do it - it's well-supported but is still a
challenge and a learning experience.

### Cost (sometimes)

If you already have access to a server or if your instance's size-based needs mean
that you can get a perfect fit using a VPS, then using a VPS is cheaper.

With a VPS, you'll have a monthly cost for the server itself, as well as a
yearly cost for a domain name. With managed hosting, you'll have the cost of
the service as well as the cost of a domain name. Often managed hosting
providers like Fedihost can provide you with a subdomain for free.

The problem for many people using a VPS is they don't have a server that
actually fits their needs well. They end up having a really slow and 
unresponsive server, or paying too much for what is actually needed.
It's a good idea to check that your VPS provider lets you indpendently
scale the CPU, RAM and disk space. Some providers offer a standard
size server which can cause a bottlekneck.

For PeerTube in particular, you have higher needs for the **video
transcoder** meaning it needs a powerful CPU but only for bursts every
once and a while. Managed hosting providers such as Fedihost have
shared transcoders, so that you don't need to pay for extra CPU resources
full time when you only need them on your limited video upload schedule.

## Advantages of managed hosting

### Ease and time

Managed hosting is, put simply, easier for most people. You don't need to
manage the inner technical workings of Mastodon - just whatever
[configuration](/articles/mastodon/creating/configuring) you see in the online
panel. This means you have to spend less time doing server administration work
and can focus on running your instance.

### Less server maintenance worries

With managed hosting, you don't need to worry about keeping the instance up to
date, security or figuring out why things have broken.

### Shared storage

If you're running multiple instances (especially different kinds, such as
Mastodon and PeerTube) with different needs for storage, FediHost and some
other managed hosting providers pool your storage across your instances. This
way, you don't pay for storage you don't need on one instance and run out of
storage on another. With a VPS, you have to manage storage capacities and
shared resources yourself. Often you are paying for a tier of storage where
much of it remains unused.
