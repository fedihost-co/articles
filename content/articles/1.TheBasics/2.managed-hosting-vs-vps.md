Managed Hosting vs. a VPS
===

## The gist

Managed hosting is a good option for people with less technical experience.
Self-hosting is a good option if you enjoy technology or have experience
programming or managing servers.

## Servers

A *server* is a computer running a program (such as Mastodon or PeerTube) that
interacts with *clients* (such as your laptop or phone) over the internet.

Generally, servers are reachable at all times. They can be a physical computer
located in your house (though there are security risks in this that you should
know), or hosted in a *datacenter* (a professionally managed location providing
space, power, and internet access for servers).

## VPS

A *virtual private server* (VPS) is a server hosted in a datacenter as a
virtual machine - that is to say, it's a virtual computer that shares hardware
resources (CPU, memory, etc.) with other VPSs. It's generally the simplest,
cheapest kind of professionally managed server you can get.

> security risks, so we won't cover it in this guide, but it is possible.

### System requirements

The kind of VPS you need depends heavily on the scale your instance will run
at. If you're just running a small instance (of either Mastodon or PeerTube)
for yourself or your friends, you can get away with as little as 1 (virtual
CPU) core and 1.5 GB of RAM. However, if you're intending to run a big
instance (lots of users, or in PeerTube's case, lots of viewers), you need to
scale up your hardware accordingly.

For PeerTube specially, you will need additional resources (as of writing, the
documentation suggests 8 vCores and 8 GB of RAM)

### Hosting Mastodon on a VPS

If you have some familiarity with the Linux command line, it's not super
difficult (though it takes a little bit of time) to get Mastodon running. The
[official documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/)
can give you a sense of what steps you need to take. You'll need to install
some prerequisites, set up a database, and download and configure a web server
and set the Mastodon server app up on it.

Typically, there will be a cost for a domain name (a web address for your
instance, e.g. consultatron.com) which you generally pay yearly, and for VPS
hosting which you generally pay monthly.

### Hosting PeerTube on a VPS

Setting up PeerTube on a VPS is quite similar to setting up Mastodon - although
it takes some time, you can do it if you're somewhat familiar with the Linux
command line. You can view the [official
documentation](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#create-your-own-instance) to know
how to do it.

You face the same costs for a domain name as well as for a VPS. However, you
should be aware that you may have higher hardware needs than for Mastodon, for
video transcoding.

## Advantages of self-hosting

### More control

When self-hosting, you have more control over your instance - you're running
and securing the server yourself. This means you have a broader choice of
location (so your users get good connection) and hardware, as well as direct
access to the database.

Also, if your country's laws or company's policies require that your digital
services be hosted onsite, then self-hosting may be necessary for compliance
reasons.

### Server administration experience

If you're interested in getting experience running servers or using Linux,
self-hosting is a great way to do it - it's well supported but is still a
challenge and a learning experience.

### Cost (sometimes)

If you already have access to a server (for instance, some universities give
their students free VPS credits), or if your needs in terms of scale mean that
you can get a perfect fit using a VPS, then

## Advantages of managed hosting

### Ease and time

Managed hosting is, put simply, easier for most people. You don't need to
manage the inner technical workings of Mastodon - just whatever
[configuration](/articles/mastodon/creating/configuring) you see in the online
panel. This means you have to spend less time doing server administration work
and can focus on running your instance.

### Less server maintenance worries

With managed hosting, you don't need to worry about keeping the instance up to
date, keeping it secure (other than making sure your configuration is sound and
your admins/moderators' passwords are secure), or figuring out why if things
break.

### Shared storage

If you're running multiple instances (especially different kinds, such as
Mastodon and PeerTube) with different needs for storage, FediHost and some
other managed hosting providers pool your storage across your instances. This
way, you don't pay for storage you don't need on one instance and run out of
storage on another. With a VPS, you have to manage storage capacities and
shared resources yourself.
